Additional Views based on user roles

Additional Considerations

- New Views if we are allowing them to set-up their available days and times
- Browser Compatibility Testing
- Mobile/Tablet Testing
- Performance in Back office views
- Security: ensure clinic security is protected and no cross over is allowed.
- Audit Logging
	- User Logs in and Logs out
	- Any addding or editting of appointment info or user details - create mirror/audit tables
